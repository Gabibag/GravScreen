# GravScreen

This was an attempt to make a platformer that required interaction with the physical window to solve. It uses JFrame (which was a terrible idea) and works somewhat well, but is not a playable game. It could be if someone with more java knowledge made this, but that is not us. Made for Lancer Hacks hackathon. This has a lot of bugs and low frames. 

### Controls
`a` for move left
`d` for move right
`w` for switch gravity up
`s` for switch gravity down
`e` to detach screen (drag it around, player can't move during this)
`q` to reattach screen (lock screen to player)
